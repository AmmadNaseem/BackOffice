# BackOffice

BackOffice is a PHP project that provides a platform for users to register, login, and manage products and categories. The project is designed to help small and medium-sized businesses to efficiently manage their inventory and product catalogs. The BackOffice project uses PHP, a popular server-side scripting language, to handle the server-side logic. It also uses MySQL, a popular relational database management system, to store and manage product and user data. The project provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily manage their products and categories. Users can register for an account, login, and access their dashboard. From the dashboard, users can add new products and categories, modify existing ones, and view sales reports. The project also provides an intuitive interface for managing products and categories. Users can add new products by providing details such as the name, description, price, and image. They can also add categories and assign products to them. Users can modify existing products and categories by editing their details. They can also delete products and categories that are no longer needed. The project ensures that all changes made to products and categories are reflected in real-time.
